function [contrast_matrix] = calculate_contrast_matrix(matrix1, matrix2, shift_weight)
% CALCULATE CONTRAST MATRIX this function will calculate an improved version of
% the contrast matrix that takes into consideration posterior/anterior
% shift
%
% matrix1 & 2: a N*N square matrix
% shift_weight: the amount of weight to put in connection that shift from
% lead to lagging and vice-versa
    
    % Here we shift the matrix1 matrix2 to check for crossing of the 0.5
    % mark
    shift_matrix1 = matrix1 - 0.5;
    shift_matrix2 = matrix2 - 0.5;
    
    % Here we want to have make a matrix that will give us a 1 for crossing
    % over and a 0 for not crossing over
    % We check which index in both shifted matrix are positive
    pos_matrix1 = shift_matrix1 > 0;
    pos_matrix2 = shift_matrix2 > 0;
    
    % We then add these two, we will get a value of 1 (one positive one
    % negative), 2 (both positive) or 0 (both negative)
    sign_matrix = pos_matrix1 + pos_matrix2;
    
    % To get the amount of crossing we put zeros everywhere and then only
    % modify the cross matrix for the index that are actually crossing.
    amount_crossing_matrix = abs(shift_matrix1 - shift_matrix2);
    cross_matrix = amount_crossing_matrix.*(sign_matrix == 1);
    
    % Finally to calculate the weight matrix we put the cross matrix
    % through the tanh function. Should give 0 for 0 values and a positive
    % value for positive input saturating at 1. We then shift that matrix
    % by 1 and weight it by the shift_weight. This will give us a 1 for the
    % region which don't cross and a scaling proportional to the amount of
    % crossing for actual cross.
    weight_matrix = shift_weight*tanh(cross_matrix) + 1;
    
    % We finally multiply the naive version of the contrast matrix with
    % the weight matrix.
    contrast_matrix = abs(matrix1 - matrix2).*weight_matrix;
