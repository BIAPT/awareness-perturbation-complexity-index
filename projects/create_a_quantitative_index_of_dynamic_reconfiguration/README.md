# Project: Create a Quantitative Index of Dynamic Reconfiguration
In this project we are aiming at creating the first rough draft of an APCI-like measure of consciousness. To do this we use feature we know from experience are associated with consciousness processing and we distill them into a number.

## Milestones
- [Create Rough dpli contrast indexes](./create_rough_dpli_contrast_indexes/README.md): This is the first forray into a dynamic reconfiguration index. We are using dPLI to create a number representing the difference between baseline, anesthesia and recovery state.
- [Augment DRI Power by Including Hub and Better dPLI](./augment_dri_power_by_including_hub_and_better_dpli/README.md): In this milestone we build on the previous project results and add hub location to the dpli-dri metric we've developed.
