# awareness-perturbation-complexity-index
Development of an index for assessing the level of consciousness of healthy and disorder of consciousness individuals.

# Structure of the codebase
At the top level we have code that are used by all experiments throughout.
There is an experiment folder per project for all code that is meant as a stepping stone in order to reach milestones. Inside this project folder we have code ordered in milestones, which are the same as those on github.
Within these experiments we have a naming convention that reflect which task it is addressing. This means we have `ex_XX_` where XX means a task number on github. 

## Projects
- [create_a_quantitative_index_of_dynamic_reconfiguration](https://github.com/BIAPT/awareness-perturbation-complexity-index/projects/1)
	- [create_rough_dpli_contrast_indexes](https://github.com/BIAPT/awareness-perturbation-complexity-index/milestone/1)

## Experiments
- [ex_04_validate_dpli_matrices](https://github.com/BIAPT/awareness-perturbation-complexity-index/issues/4)
- [ex_05_generate_dpli_contrast_matrices](https://github.com/BIAPT/awareness-perturbation-complexity-index/issues/5)
- [ex_06_generate_first_draft_dri_dpi](https://github.com/BIAPT/awareness-perturbation-complexity-index/issues/6)

# Notes
- WSAS17 is missing recovery since we couldn't get cleaned data for this epoch.
- WSAS02 data was gathered with brainVision headset (see .doc/wsas02_information) to know how to translate this headset to the EGI headset we are using for all the other participant.
