# Report of Create Rough dPLI Contrast Indexes 
This is the report for the milestone `create rough dpli contrast indexes.` 

## Why is the documentation here?
The documentation was in the wiki page of Github, I (yacine mahdid) decided to switch to an in-code documentation for two reasons:
1. To not be tied to Github for documenting and reporting
2. To be able to version control the documentation page

I'm open to other suggestions to document the code and the analysis, however due to the highly changing nature of the analysis it is difficult to keep the documentation up-to-date the further away from the code it lies.
